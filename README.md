# NanoLocz-MATLAB-Library üì¶  
*A MATLAB library for atomic force microscopy (AFM) image analysis*

NanoLocz-lib is a lightweight, scriptable MATLAB library designed for high-throughput AFM, high-speed AFM (HS-AFM), and Localization-AFM (LAFM) image analysis. It provides the core functionality behind the [NanoLocz GUI app](https://github.com/George-R-Heath/NanoLocz) for users who prefer scripting or batch processing workflows.

## üõ† Requirements

NanoLocz-lib uses core MATLAB and requires the following toolboxes:

- Image Processing Toolbox  
- Computer Vision Toolbox  
- Signal Processing Toolbox  
- Curve Fitting Toolbox  
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox  
- Optimization Toolbox

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Add the NanoLocz-lib folder (and its subfolders) to your MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('path/to/NanoLocz-lib'))

3. Call functions directly in your scripts, see the [Example Workbooks](https://github.com/George-R-Heath/NanoLocz-Matlab-Library/tree/main/Example%20Workbooks) scripts included in the repository as templates for common analysis workflows.
